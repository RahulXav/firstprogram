		<h1>VISION</h1>
		<p>
			In a world in turmoil caused by war, economic pressures and environmental problems, it is easy to forget that we are not the only species living and surviving on this planet.<br>

Large scale interference by humans in the animal world and nature is causing immense suffering for animals and nature alike.<br>

Compassion for all living beings is the driving force to rescue and rehabilitate animals in distress.<br>

We hope that compassion expressed in action will create a new balance in the human-animal-nature relationship. This is in the interest of all living beings.<br>
